- `ELECTRA` - This work introduces a new pre-training objective called replaced-token detection which is more efficient than the traditional masked language modeling objective. [<span style="color:blue">[Slides]</span>](https://ameet-1997.github.io/files/ELECTRA.key)
- `Plug and Play Language Models` - This work introduces simple approach that can control the text generation based on attributes. [<span style="color:blue">[Slides]</span>](https://ameet-1997.github.io/files/PlugAndPlay.key)
- `Abstractive and Extractive Summarization` - Presented two key papers for text summarization using neural networks. [<span style="color:blue">[Slides]</span>](https://ameet-1997.github.io/files/DL_for_NLP.pptx)
- `A Laplacian Framework for Option Discovery in Reinforcement Learning` - Presented usefulness of Proto-Value Functions and the paper's laplacian framework for finding useful options. [<span style="color:blue">[Slides]</span>](https://ameet-1997.github.io/files/LaplacianFramework.pdf)
- `Dataless Classification` - Presented the idea of using semantic information in label names and how this idea dovetails with co-training. [<span style="color:blue">[Slides]</span>](https://ameet-1997.github.io/files/DatalessClassification.pdf)
- `Children search for information as efficiently as adults, but seek additional confirmatory evidence` - Presented a cognitive approach to explaining how children and adults search for information equally efficiently but differ in the implementation of the stopping rule along with a primer on ANOVA and Bonferroni corrected multiple comparisons.
