## Abstract

The CLEVR dataset has been used extensively in language grounded visual reasoning
in Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains. We present
a graph parser library for CLEVR, that
provides functionalities for object-centric attributes and relationships extraction, and con-
struction of structural graph representations
for dual modalities. Structural order-invariant
representations enable geometric learning and
can aid in downstream tasks like language
grounding to vision, robotics, compositionality, interpretability, and computational grammar construction. We provide three extensible
main components â€“ parser, embedder, and
visualizer that can be tailored to suit specific
learning setups. We also provide out-of-the-box functionality for seamless integration with
popular deep graph neural network (GNN) libraries. Additionally, we discuss downstream
usage and applications of the library, and how
it accelerates research for the NLP research community.
